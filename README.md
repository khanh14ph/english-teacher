Run API:

`python3 api.py --model <model_name> --auth_token <your_ngrok_auth_token>`

`model_name` can be `al` or `apl`

Please be aware that it is necessary to create an ngrok account (link: https://ngrok.com/) and retrieve your account's auth token in order to pass it into the `auth_token` in `api`.

This code will display a public URL. You need to copy this URL and assign it to the `url` variable in the `app.py` file on your local computer. Please note that the `app.py` file cannot be executed on a remote server.# english-teacher
